Example illustrating how you can take the sorting applied in a DISPLAY ARRAY and apply it to the underlying 4gl array

This example arose out of this forum discussion http://4js.com/fjs_forum/index.php?topic=1289.  Could I display an array in a DISPLAY ARRAY, sort it, and then display it in a MENU/FIRST/PREVIOUS/NEXT/LAST pattern in the same order
